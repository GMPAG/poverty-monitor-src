To do:

1) Add hovers to map

2) Change basemap dynamically. labels above for lsoa, labels below for LA

3) Remove indicators when there are only zero values at the relevant scale - DONE!!!

4) Make chart work - DONE!!!

5) Add title / label / whatever to table - DONE!!!

6) Make descriptions work

7) Redefine chloropleth around average - DONE!!! by excluding big things.

8) Add landing page and menu items

9) Reskin for new site


Idea: Accept a range of detail levels in PovmonDataset interface. This allows
client code to choose LA versus LA+BIG without having to filter out unwanted
stuff afterwards.
