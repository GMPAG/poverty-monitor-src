To do:

Find out why indicator 'undefined' being reported on vis load

Use new data with neg codes - make code edits to detect "< 0" where we currently detect "= 0"

Add hovers to map


Ideas:

Accept a range of detail levels in PovmonDataset interface. This allows
client code to choose LA versus LA+BIG without having to filter out unwanted
stuff afterwards.


Done:

Redefine chloropleth around average - DONE!!! by excluding big things.

Remove indicators when there are only zero values at the relevant scale - DONE!!!

Make chart work - DONE!!!

Add title / label / whatever to table - DONE!!!

Change basemap dynamically. labels above for lsoa, labels below for LA - DONE!!! by using two different static maps.

Make descriptions work

Add landing page and menu items
