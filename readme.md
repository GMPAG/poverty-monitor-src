# GMPAG poverty monitor source for static site generator

The GMPAG [poverty monitor sub-site](http://gmpag.l/poverty-monitor/indicator-visualisations/?level=local-authority-and-region) has previously been a plain [HTML/JS website](https://github.com/GMPAG/poverty-monitor). This has been problematic because, in order to keep the look of the main site, it has been necessary to copy-paste changes in the main site screen-furniture in to each page of the sub-site. Now that the site has been moved to the [Buzby](https://github.com/crantok/buzby) static site generator, these changes will only have to be made to the layout file.
